**BATTLESHIP**

A game of wits, nerve andâ€¦ well, it's pretty easy to see what's going on here in this game of Battleship.

Built in Python based on one of the advanced questions on codeacademy.com, this is the solution.

You can get more advanced by using this code to push data online (multiplayer mode) or have more than one ship, etc. etc.

Based on a 5x5 grid.

Enjoy!
